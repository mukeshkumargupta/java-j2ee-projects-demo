# Multi-agent Java sample with Spring AI and Azure Cosmos DB

Inspired by OpenAI Swarm and LangGraph - a sample personal shopping AI Chatbot that can help with product enquiries, making sales, and refunding orders by transferring to different agents for those tasks.

Features:
- **Multi-agent**: the sample implements a custom multi-agent orchestration framework using [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/) and [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) as building blocks. 
- **Transactional data management**: agents interact with the planet scale [Azure Cosmos DB database service](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/introduction) using [Spring AI tool calling](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/tools-migration.html) to store transactional user and product operational data, implemented via [Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data). 
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: the sample uses [vector search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search) in Azure Cosmos DB with powerful [DiskANN index](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/diskann-fast-accurate-billion-point-nearest-neighbor-search-on-a-single-node/?msockid=091c323873cd6bd6392120ac72e46a98) to serve product enquiries from the same database that is used for transactions. Implemented via the [Spring AI vector store plugin for Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/vectordbs/azure-cosmos-db.html).
- **Long term chat memory persistence**: the sample implements Spring AI's `ChatMemory` interface to store and manage long term chat memory for each user session in Azure Cosmos DB.
- **Multi-tenant/user session storage**: [Hierarchical Partitioning](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/hierarchical-partition-keys) is used in Azure Cosmos DB to store and manage each user session, this is integrated into the UI. A "default" `tenantId` is used, and the user's local IP address is captured as the `userId`.
- **UI**: front end is built as a single-page application (SPA) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript located in the resources/static folder. The UI talks to REST API endpoints exposed by the backend Spring Boot application.

## Overview

The personal shopper example includes 3 agents to handle various customer service requests, and an orchestrator for initial routing. The agents are implemented using [Spring AI](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/) to interact with the Azure OpenAI API. The agents are designed to be modular and can be easily extended or replaced with other implementations.

1. **Product Agent**: Answers customer queries from the products container using [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/gen-ai/rag).
2. **Refund Agent**: Manages customer refunds, requiring both user ID and item ID to initiate a refund.
3. **Sales Agent**: Handles actions related to placing orders, requiring both user ID and product ID to complete a purchase.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure Cosmos DB account](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/create-cosmosdb-resources-portal) - ensure the [vector search](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/vector-search) feature is enabled.
- [Azure OpenAI API account](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview).
- [Azure OpenAI Embedding Deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) for the RAG model of `text-embedding-ada-002` (with deployment ID of the same).
- [Azure OpenAI Chat Deployment](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/overview) for the chat model of `gpt-4o-mini` (with deployment ID of the same).
- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) 3.8.1 or later installed.
- [Java 17](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html) or later installed.

## Setup

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/AzureCosmosDB/multi-agent-spring-ai.git
cd multi-agent-spring-ai
```

Ensure you have the following environment variables set:
```shell
AZURE_COSMOSDB_ENDPOINT=your_cosmosdb_account_uri
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_azure_openai_endpoint
```

Ensure that your Azure OpenAI account has the following models deployed (references in `application.properties`):

- `gpt-4o-mini` for chat
- `text-embedding-ada-002` for embeddings

## Running the app

### Authenticate

The sample uses [DefaultAzureCredential](https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme?view=azure-java-stable#authenticate-a-user-assigned-managed-identity-with-defaultazurecredential) when connecting to both Azure OpenAI and Azure Cosmos DB. Be sure you have appropriate [data plane RBAC access to your Azure Cosmos DB account](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cosmos-db/nosql/security/how-to-grant-data-plane-role-based-access?tabs=built-in-definition%2Ccsharp&pivots=azure-interface-cli) and for your Azure OpenAI account, then authenticate to Azure locally:

```shell
az login
```

### Compile

```shell
mvn clean package
```


### Start the web server

```shell
java -jar target/multi-agent-spring-ai-cosmos-1.0-exec.jar
